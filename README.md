# Book Finder

  

Book Finder is my cs50x (2021) final project and was inspired by florinpop17 [app ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). To create this web page I decided to use Flask, Javascript and Google Books API. I chose this project to learn more about javascript and how to consume a external API.
