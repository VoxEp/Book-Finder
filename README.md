# Book Finder

  
Book Finder was inspired by florinpop17 [app ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). This application allow users to search for books by entering a query (title, author, publisher, etc) and display all books found in a list on the page with corresponding data.

## Freatures

- Book Finder allow users to **search for books** by multiple criteria (title, author, publisher, etc) 

- The web page **display all books** found in a list on the page with corresponding data. 

- Since Google Books API only admit at maximum 40 books per request, the webpage offers a **pagination index** that allows user to look all books found

- The webpage offers a **responsive design** fitting at most screen sizes. 

- When the site searches for books, a **loading animation** is shown.

- User can access a secondary page for **more book details**

- If available, user can **check a sample and buy the book** (external link to google)

 ## Possible improvements
As all applications this one can also be improved. Possible improvements:

 - Have database for user account allowing users to: 
	 - Score books
	 - Add book to a personal wish list
	 - Personal profile dashboard 
 - Allow users to post a comment (review) for a specific book
 - Show random books at index
